## Custom RSS Reader
An ongoing project where I (Quinn) try to make my own version of an RSS reader so I can keep track of the three thousand news sites I check every day in a single place. (Don't ask me why I don't just use Feedly.) (okay fine i'll tell you) (I just never got into it and I think it'd be fun, if not time-consuming and irrational, to try and create my own using what I know about Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.)

My dream is to make something that's actually functional that can be downloaded as a basic local package (maybe using Electron?), where you can plug in the websites you want to view the RSS feed of, or at the very least, have it come with some basic news sites, but I'm thinking WAY ahead right now and that is a problem for future Quinn.

### Update: 2024/2/29
Happy leap day! Added the VERY BASIC scraping program I wrote in Python using [feedparser](https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/), using a few of my commonly visited sites as an example. Currently it's at its bare bones and runs entirely within a `while` loop, with zero practical interface.
